In this measurement, the nucleus used was $^{20}$F.

\section{Theory Parameters}

For the q-value of the decay, the atomic masses of $^{20}$Ne and $^{20}$F were used.
The decay of $^{20}$F of interest decays to an excited state of the $^{20}$Ne.
The energy of the gamma ray was measured to 0.015 keV \cite{Til98}.

Using the numbers described above and equation \ref{eq:qval}, the q-value for $^{20}$F is 5.901928 (82).
The largest source of uncertainty is in the mass of $^{20}$F.
