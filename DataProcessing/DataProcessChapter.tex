The detector were tested using an oscilliscope to check for their signals.
The signals were then inserted into a digital data acqusition system.

\section{Data acquisiton}

All the signals for all the detectors were sent to digitizers.
These digitizers were three 250 mega-samples per second 16 channel XIA PIXIE modules. 
They were run with the digital NSCL system.
The first module had the implant detectors and the four gamma detectors. 
The second module had five signals from the PPAC and one signal for the Si dector. 
Both of these had the beam on signal, beam off signal, a 100 Hz pulser, and the signal from the PIN photodiode. 
The third module only recorded the digitized waveforms from the PVT detector.

Each of the channels on each of those modules outputted a time stamp and an energy calculated from a trapezoidal fitler.
The third module output the digitized waveform over 400ns.
The clock used was a stable EPSON SGR-8002JC programmable crystal oscillator.

The first thing the PIXIE modules did was to digitize the wave forms of the signals.
The digital wave forms of the signals were only saved for the PVT implant detector.
The PIXIE modules' software applied a trapezoidal energy filter to the digital wave froms.
The parameters of the trapezoidal needed to be set by hand.
There was also a trigger filter in the PIXIE system.

\subsection{Data Acquisition Sofware}
In order to set the parameters of the various filters, a program called NSCOPE was used \cite{REFHERE}
The program GUI was used to set the rise time, the gap, and the threshold for both the energy filter and the trigger filter.
These parameters were set differently for each detector type.
The CsI(Na) detectors (the implant and the 4 gamma detectors) shared the rise time and gap time, while other detectors had different parameters.
Sample spectra were taken with NSCOPE, and the parameters saved to a file.

This file was loaded with a program called ReadOut, which ran the data taking.
The ReadOut program used a ringbuffer in order to record the output of the data.
The program recorded data as an .evt binary file if the record data button was checked.

The ringbuffer was also fed to a program called scalers.
This gave the rates of the events coming into each channel.
It gave an input rate to each channel, the recorded rate, and the total over each run.
This was to check how each channel in each module was doing.

For online analysis, a program called SpecTcl was used.
It took the evt files and processed them into histograms.
These histograms could be put in coincidence.
Displays of the implant detector energy and rate were displayed.
The energy of the implant vs time was also displayed.
Additionally, the implant energy vs time since last beam on was plotted as a 2-D spectra.
The decay curves (time in implant minus last beam on) were also plotted.
These histograms were used as diagnostics. 

\section{Data Taking and Processing}
To take data, the ReadOut program was activated. 
Data was taken in one hour intervals, unless one of the detectors stopped counting early
If a detector stopped early, it was the up detector.
The run was then ended early and then a new one resarted.

The resulting .evt files of ReadOut were processed using a program called DDAS dumper.
This converted the .evt files to ROOT files.
These ROOT files contained a TTRee that had the energy and time stamps of each detector.
There was also information on the trace of the detector.

From the ROOT files from the ddasdumper, another ROOT file was built.
These files were processed with a code called scan, which was written by Stan Paulauskas.
First, the various energies and times for each detector were built into a histogram.
Then, the energy and times for the implant detectors, four gamma detectors, beam on signal, and beam off signals were saved to a variable.
This information was used to build new events for a new TTree.

Each event started with a non-zero energy reading in any of the five detectors.
Then, a 400 ns long time gate opened, during which all energies and times were saved into the event.
The time signatures of the last beam on and beam off signals were also saved into each event.
The energies of the beam on or beam off signals were 0 or 1.
