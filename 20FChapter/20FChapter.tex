For a potential beta decay shape measurement, several criteria for a nucleus are needed.
The first is that the nucleus and the decay mode must be available in sufficient quantities that a proper decay spectrum shape can be measured.
This means that the nucleus needs to be relatively close to stability.
The decay mode needs to be clean.
If there are several competing decay modes of similar strength, the shape of the beta decay spectrum gets complicated.
The same thing happens if there are several gamma rays in the decay. 
Having one gamma ray is useful, as a coincidence measurement can be used to exclude much of any background spectra in the measurement.
In order to get a useful theoretical interpretation of the measurement of the Fierz term, a purely Fermi or Gamow-Teller transition is needed.
The superallowed decays are purely Fermi, so the limit on any potential scalar couplings is strong.
An allowed Gamow-Teller transition gives sensitivity to any potential couplings. 
A nucleus that fulfills these criteria is $^{20}$F. 
 
\section{$^{20}$F Decay Characteristics}
The decay scheme is given in figure \ref{fig:DecayScheme}.

	\caption{The decay scheme of $^{20}$F.}
	\label{fig:DecayScheme}
\end{figure}

As seen in the figure, $^{20}$F decays 99.999\% of the time to the first excited state of $^{20}$Ne.
This decay is very clean, as there are very few contaminants from other decay branches. 
The $2^{+}$ state seen in the decay scheme is not the isobaric analogue state to the ground state of $^{20}$F.
That state is much higher in energy.
The beta decay therefor has a isospin change of 1.
This means that the allowed Fermi matrix element is zero, and the decay is an allowed Gamow-Teller transition. 
The forbidden transitions contribute <INSERT THEORY HERE> 
The half-life of $^{20}$F is about 11 seconds. 
This means waiting for the $^{20}$F to decay will take less than a minute to get good statistics.

The 1.6 MeV gamma ray in the transition allows for a coincidence measurement to take place.
One gamma ray does not distort the spectrum enough to cause any issues.
$^{20}$F is relatively close to stability. 
It can be made in sufficient qualities to get a good beta quality beta spectrum.
Because of these characteristics, this measurement was not the first to measure $^{20}$F.

\section{Previous Measurments of $^{20}$F}

Some of the earliest measurements of $^{20}$F where $ft$ value measurements \cite{Wil70} \cite{Alb75}.
The half-lives were measured with a plastic-scintillator in either case.  
These $ft$ values were compared to the mirror nucleus $^{20}$Na in order to search for second class currents in beta decay. 

Another, more recent measurement whose goal was putting limits on second class currents was done with with a polarized $^{20}$F and $^{20}$Na beam \cite{Min11}.
The technique was an alignment measurement over different energies instead of an $ft$ value. 
The $^{20}$F was made with a polarized deuteron beam impinging on a $^{19}$F target. 
The direction of the outgoing electron was measured and recorded.
The angular distribution was measured using the beta-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique.
The correlations were corrected for and plotted vs energy.
The outcome of this graph was a measurement of the various form factors that correct the beta decay spectrum shape. 
The resulting $^{20}$F energy spectrum is shown in figure \ref{fig:keispec}

\end{figure}

In the energy spectrum in figure \ref{fig:keispec}, there are several background spectra. 
Since this measurement  was an asymmetry measurement, the influence of the backgrounds are reduced. 
Different polarization were used to eliminate systematic effects.
Double ratios were taken to account for difference in solid angle and detector effiency.
The threshold was taken to be 2 MeV, as below that energy, the spectrum is distorted.
A good limit on second class currents was found.

A similar measurement of the $^{20}$F spectrum shape was done with a spectrometer \cite{Elm87}.
The goal was to measure the nuclear shape factor and get a measurement of the linear term.
This shape factor will be described further in a later chapter.
The ultimate goal was to test the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis. 
For this experiment, the direction of the outgoing electrons was not recorded.
$^{20}$F was created with a deuteron beam on a $^{19}$F target, much like the previous experiment.
The target was $^{6}$LiF on a carbon foil.
After the target was bombarded, and the $^{20}$F created, the outgoing electron went through the foil and into the spectrometer.
The spectrometer was tuned to accept a certain energy of electrons. 
Then, data on the decay of $^{20}F$ at different energies were collected.
A sample energy spectrum is shown in figure \ref{fig:elmspec}.

\end{figure}

An important consideration is the normalization of each point.
For each spectrometer setting, the amount of measurement time, the acceptence of the spectrometer, and the source activity have to be accounted for.
To help with the normalization, a beta telescope near the target was used.
This measures the activity of the source, and takes into account the degradation of the target.
However, there are still issues with adjusting for the effieciency of the beta telescope.
This efficiency changes as the spectrometer's field is changed.
The location of the telescope was optimised to minimize this effect.
Another way of normalization was to countinuesly adjust the spectrometer field so that a the entire energy range is sampled over each measurement cycle.
The issue there is that changing the magnetic fields induces currents, which are hard to correct for. 
In this measurement, adjusting the spectrometer field was used as a benchmark for the beta telescope normalization method.

Using a single scintillator would take care of the normalization automatically.

In order to get at the Fierz term, the beta decay spectrum shape must be described precisely.
The next chapter deals with the corrections to the beta decay spectrum.
